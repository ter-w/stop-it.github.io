When the experiment is hosted on a web server (i.e. online experiments), the data will be automatically written to the data file after every trial. Thus, **data will be available when online experiments are aborted before the end**. The files will be stored in this folder.

For experiments that are hosted on a local computer (i.e. offline experiments), data will be written to the data file at the end of the experiment. Thus, **no data are saved if local experiments are aborted before the end**. When the data are stored, a Download window will open (in the browser) and researchers can select the data folder.
